**Hyperlocal Delivery Pooling for College Campuses**

Getting late-night cravings but your cart value is only ₹90? Don't pay the ₹40 delivery fee. **SplitIt** connects you with other students in your hostel or campus ordering from quick-commerce apps (like Blinkit or Zepto) so you can combine your orders, hit the free delivery threshold, and save money.

## 🚀 The Problem & Solution
* **The Problem:** Quick-commerce apps charge heavy delivery fees for small carts (usually under ₹199). Students often abandon carts or overspend just to avoid the fee.
* **The Solution:** A platform where a "Host" lists their open cart, and a "Guest" adds their items to it. They split the bill, share the delivery, and nobody pays the extra fee.

## 📱 How It Works (The Core Flow)
1. **Broadcast:** User A (Host) needs ₹60 more for free delivery and posts their cart status and location (e.g., "Main Gate").
2. **Match:** User B (Guest) wants an item worth ₹80. They request to join User A's cart.
3. **Lock & Pay:** User A accepts. User B pays User A their share (via UPI or Cash on Meet).
4. **Order & Split:** User A places the combined order. Once delivered, they meet at the designated spot to hand over the items.

## 🚧 Current Status: Phase 1 (Concierge MVP)
Currently, SplitIt is operating as a **WhatsApp Community MVP** to validate user demand, test the logistics of physical handovers, and establish a high-trust environment on campus.
